# Welcome to my blog thingy
Hi, I'm Qba01. As the text above says welcome.
As some may tell I'm not used to posting, I prefer lurking but I decided that it might be a good opportunity to share what I do when I can actually share it.
Also I think it might become a good habbit which pushes me to focus more on cyber stuff and allow me to grow my knowledge further.

So what I intend to do with this. 
For starters I'm planning on posting writeups/less formal reports of disected malware or anything that might be seen as a cybersecurity related puzzle. I'm also intending on keeping this blog mostly cybersecurity related but who knows I might do something else from time to time.

Also while I'm at it, I'm going to write everything what I post by myself, unless I would quote someone or share snippets of something related to current topic and when there would be an exception I can always mention it. I could use some Ai, I'm all for making things easier and automating some tasks, hovewer I think it's just another slippery slope, it's easy to overuse it and not using brain for thinking is probably as bad in the long run as I think it is. So it would be one way to not let the brain start degenerating and losing the ability to think, especially in current age of information where everything should be revised, to not get caught up into thinking that some bad generative ai image is real (which actually starts getting harder each time new model gets released :| ). 
So yeah, to improve the things rather than *reverse this process* I will restrain myself from doing that. Sure it's helpfull in searching stuff (it's undermining search engines kind of) or quickly explaining things but yes, I have other plans. 2nd reason: on the first look when asked about foregin topic it is convincing and we might think that all which was generated was true, but as time has shown it does make mistakes or lies and gaslights users. So this might be one of those *human aspects* of ai(?). For sure it will get better but meeeh, as long as corporations will be trying to earn by developing something like that which doesn't actually help the average people but instead "allows" art to be more accessible and steals the fun from creating something by yourself :/ 

Yup I didn't think I wwould start ranting, it wasn't in my draft versions. But welp I think I will post it anyway. Also it could be good if I won't use "unprofesional" words, I mean those "welps, meh" and so on. 

Okay so going back to the main topic. I will try to post reports, writeups and similar things here in semiregularly.

Thanks for reading all to the end, it's longer than I expected (*that's what she said*) the first post to be and still I have to figure out how to do the formatting so it would be easier to read.
