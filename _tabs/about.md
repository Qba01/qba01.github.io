Something about me. I enjoy tinkering in stuff, probably that's why reversing and analyzing malware gives me so much fun. Also it's like a puzzle which in a way is not supposed to be understood which makes this process even more satisfying when it's successfully reversed. But it's takes some time which is as I'm figuring out year by year is scarcer.
I got into interested in cybersecurity when I was trying to figure out what do I want to do. Everyone goes through it, not everyone has a chance to work in field which they would like to so I feel kind of lucky. Well unfortunatelly the circumstances in which the world is currently are still more distopian than utopian.

Anyway I like learning and aggregating random facts and so on. 

Event writing this blog like things is kind of satisfying.
